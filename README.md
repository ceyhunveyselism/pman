# PMan
This is a multipurpose tool used for a bunch of things mainly focused on passwords, encryption and a bunch of other stuff.
This program is not focused on one specific usage: however mostly weighted on stuff involving passwords.
This program was just a hobby for me to make in python and spend my time with so don't expect anything too professional though this is a pretty good program for my skill level
